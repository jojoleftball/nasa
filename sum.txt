Biogalactic is a revolutionary full-stack web application that democratizes access to NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), transforming how researchers and students explore space biology. With an intuitive cosmic-themed interface and AI-powered insights, it bridges the gap between complex space research data and accessible scientific discovery.

KEY FEATURES:
- AI Research Assistant "Ria" powered by Google Gemini for interpreting research data
- Advanced search with filters (organism, experiment type, mission, year, tissue type)
- Real-time data visualization showing research trends and statistics
- Direct integration with NASA OSDR API for authentic research papers
- Admin panel for curating featured research entries
- User authentication with personalized interests and favorites
- Chat history persistence and research pathway recommendations

WHY BIOGALACTIC STANDS OUT:
The platform uniquely combines real NASA OSDR data with admin-curated content, creating a comprehensive knowledge hub for space biology. Its AI assistant doesn't just searchâ€”it understands context, suggests related studies, and helps users discover research pathways they might never have found through traditional search methods. The elegant cosmic interface transforms data exploration into an immersive experience, making cutting-edge space biology research accessible to everyone from students to professional researchers. With persistent chat history and personalized recommendations, Biogalactic learns from each interaction, becoming smarter and more helpful over time.
